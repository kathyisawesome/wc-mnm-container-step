## Important

1. This is proof of concept and not officially supported in any way.
2. Best suited for dynamic pricing mode and shipped separately packing mode.

## Usage

In the "Mix and Match" tab of the Product Data metabox you will now see a "Container step size" input. This is the number that the total quantity must be a multiple of in order for the container to be valid.
